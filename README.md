# SHM-Attert-Adaptive-Clustering
Code and sample data for adaptive clustering, demonstrated with SHM model of the Attert catchment

Main script: shm_attert_dynac

To run the SHM model in various modes, adjust variable 'dynac_yesno' in script 'shm_attert_dynac'
0=standard mode
1=dynamical clustering mode
2=static clustering mode

To adjust the number of time steps used in simulation, adjust variable 'num_ts'
in script 'shm_load_and_initialize'
